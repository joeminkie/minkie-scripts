### Layer Comps to Files.jsx

When I found out about Layer Comps in Photoshop two things bugged me: 1) It defaulted to printing 4 digits (0000, 0001, 0002...) which I think is overkill — who has over 999 layer comps in their psd? — and 2) It started at 0 instead of 1. 

So I edited the Layer Comps to Files... script so that it will only print 2 digits and you can specify where to start counting (it defaults to 1 if you leave it blank). If you want to use it you can download it and replace the original in your photoshop folder: (Mac) /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS4/Presets/Scripts/Layer Comps To Files.jsx. I couldn't figure out how to add it as a new script.
